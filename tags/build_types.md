## Build Typesâ€‹

### Stable
Stable builds are tested the most. They are perfect for production systems.
### Development
Development builds contain new features. Those are already tested and will not change usually. If you feel a bit adventurous you can use those already on your server.
### Snapshots
Snapshots are living on the edge. They might break the plugin and corrupt data. Those should be never used on a production server, but it might be fun to test new stuff on a test system
