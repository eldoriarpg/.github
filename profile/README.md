## How Eldoria was founded

Eldoria was founded as an RPG server.
We planned to make an unique RPG experience within Minecraft with unique self written plugins like every other RPG server wants. Sadly we lacked the resources to make our plans become real. 
owever we wanted to share the work we already had invested into our projects with others. That's why we initially created this organization.

## What is Eldoria today

Today we are a loose group of developers.
We maintain multiple projects here in this organization and in other places like the [Landlord](https://github.com/LandlordPlugin) organization.
All our plugins are open source, because we think it is important to share knowledge end technology. 
We also think that every user and server owner should be able to build and inspect the plugins they use on their own.

Most of our plugins are published on [spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/585216/).

## Noteable Projects

These are some of our most notably projects. We invested a lot of time in these and are happy to publish the source code here.

### [Schematic Brush Reborn](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/SchematicBrushReborn)
Schematic Brush Reborn is a revive of the old [Schematic Brush](https://github.com/mikeprimm/SchematicBrush) and the successor of Schematic Brush Reborn V1.

However it is not really the old schematic brush and has a way better usability.
It features several new features which will make creating Schematic Brushes as simple as possible!
It also adds several new features like block place masks, new modifiers, realtime preview and modification.

We also have several Add-ons for it like [Grid Selector](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/gridselector),
[Schematic Brush Database](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/schematic-brush-database),
[Schematic Tools](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/schematic-tools),
[Survival Schematic Brush](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/survivalschematicbrush)

### [Pick Me Up](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/PickMeUp)
Do you find leashes as boring as I do?

If yes: PickMeUp is your plugin! If no: You gonna love it anyway!

Pick me Up allows you to pick up every existing entity.
You can enable and disable pick up for every entity (Players as well if you want).
You can also define a permission for every entity.
Because this is not enough and just let them down again is lame you can throw them away.
And yes you can pickup someone who picked up someone. Reach the sky!

### [Big Doors Opener](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/BigDoorOpener)

Big doors opener is an addon for [Big Doors](https://github.com/PimvanderLoos/BigDoors).

Big doors opener allows you to open doors based on conditions.
These conditions can be items, which the player needs to activate at a specific block or just hold it in its hand.
Or you can open a door when a player is near it or inside a specific region.
You can also open a door based on a player permission, world time or the weather.
